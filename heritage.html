	<p>My ethnicity is Yoruba. They are a group of people (several hundreds of tribes) scattered mainly around the southern parts of Nigeria, a republic in West Africa. They have a very rich culture and traditions. They wear bright colorful clothes with beautfiul patters in various styles.</p>
	<p>Food</p>
