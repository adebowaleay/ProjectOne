	<p>My name is Ayobami Adebowale. I am currently pursuing a Co-terminal degree, and will be receiving my B.S. and M.S. in  in Information Technology Management as well as a minor in Human Resources in the Spring of 2020. I recently discovered my love for leadership and programming after and made the very difficult decision after two years as a biomedical engineering pre-med major to switch majors. I have undergone several leadership trainings and attended many conferences to professionaly develop myself in hopes to use apply these experiences as a Scrum Master or Project Manager at an idealy small startup.</p>

	<p> Music is a huge part of my life! I listen to music a lot (at least one song and hour) and I think that is so healing and theraputic. It is amazing that there is a different song and genre fo revery mood and also to fit every type of personaloty.</p>
